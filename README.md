# HotelRez

A small pair of azure functions that pull in the weather data for a selected area and saves them to a sql db

an example long/lat 
"LondonLong": "0.1278",
"LondonLat": "51.5072",

logging might need improving and the configuration being accessed via DI is not my usual method

I would prefer to use a model to limit the access to other local settings.
